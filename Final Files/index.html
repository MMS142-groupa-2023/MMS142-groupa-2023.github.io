      <h1>WHAT ARE SMART CITIES?</h1>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fourth industrial revolution of the present, characterized by the Internet, digitalization, and the obscuring distinctions between physical and virtual worlds,
        industries everywhere are disrupted (Majumdar, et al., 2018). Local government units have no exemption. To keep up with these times of rapid technological advancements,
        cities in particular, implement various disruptive technologies in soft and hard infrastructures, hoping to improve the quality of life– from governance, economy, tourism, and
        recreation, to social welfare. These are smart cities, cities that strategically capitalize on Information Communication Technology (ICT) aiming for success, efficiency, and 
        competitiveness in various socioeconomic aspects (Angelidou, 2014). Angelidou (2014) elaborates that the term “smart city” is considered ambiguous, as the preconceived notion
        that technological implementation immediately makes a city smart and the biased usage of the word “smart” perpetuates misunderstanding and ambiguity of what smart cities
        are. Even so, much literature shows that the smart city concept describes a myriad of heterogeneous solutions and city programs that employ and are mainly driven by various
        technologies, especially ICTs which connect different entities to provide digital services, to reach a set of goals (Dameri, 2013).

        <h2>FIRST, WHAT IS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY?</h2>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invention classified as disruptive technology is one that fundamentally 
          changes how customers, markets, or companies function. Disruptive technologies have the potential to reshape economies, redefine 
          business models, and revolutionize the way we live and work.&nbsp; It can revolutionize various sectors, such as transportation, 
          healthcare, and communication. A great example of disruptive technology in today’s era includes ride-sharing applications,
          GPS systems, e-commerce, and online news sources. Way back then, television, electricity, and cars were also classified as disruptive technology. (Smith, 2022)

    <h2>HOW ARE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IMPLEMENTED IN SMART CITIES?</h2>
    <div class="implement=info">
      <img src="images/city.png">
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we know what a smart city is, it is crucial to see how disruptive technologies interweave with the makings of a smart city. 
        According to the Department of Science and Technology (2021), the smart city, as an ecosystem,  
        provides various services that assure and enable information exchange, analysis, and statistics for the efficient usage of resources. 
        Technology facilitates just that. With technology, the exchange, analysis, and statistical-making of information are done efficiently. 
        And because information is shared and processed more quickly and efficiently, societal operations become more productive.
        ICTs and digitalization, in particular, update old processes with new and convenient ways for consumers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOST (2021) identifies sustainable, efficient, and productive economic opportunity, education, environmental quality and natural resource conservation, finance, governance, health, safety 
        and security, infrastructure, transportation, urban planning, and empowerment and inclusivity as indicators of a smarter city. Facilitated and supported by the effective implementation of disruptive technologies,
        different sectors, and citizens can inch forward toward reaching these indicators, becoming smarter cities.

    <h2>SMART CITY GROWTH FORECAST</h2>
    <h4>Smart Cities in the Philippines and Current Initiatives</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An article by Lamentillo (2022) discusses the prospects of smart cities in the Philippines. 
      Lamentillo reports that as a part of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) established by the ASEAN in 2018, the Philippines is committed to
      achieving various smart city projects in Manila, Cebu, and Davao City. Lamentillo further points out that according to a study by the Philippine Institute
      for Development Studies (PIDS), issues arise and hinder the strive toward smart city development, such as operational costs and inoperability. 
      Hence, she notes that LGUs must set up the necessary ICT infrastructure and systems to facilitate these smart city initiatives, however, even with LGU’s 
      existing ICT infrastructure, keeping their systems up to date with the constant advancement of technology can be quite expensive.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lamentillo (2022) also reports that the Philippines’ first smart, resilient, and green metropolis is expected to be the Bases Conversion and Development Authority’s (BCDA) New Clark City, which aims to decongest Metro Manila and spur growth in Central Luzon and other provinces.
          It is indicated that once completed, it will potentially house one million residents and provide jobs for about 600,000 Filipinos. Furthermore, it is reported that the BCDA has set up several anticipated impactful projects and programs in New Clark City, i.e. sustainability, ICT, estate management, transportation, tourism, and smart city technologies.

      <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
      <p>
        Simeon (2022) recently wrote an article discussing the PIDS study, which identifies several obstacles that the Philippines faces in its efforts to develop smart cities. Despite the country's progress, various factors are hindering its success.
      </p>
      <p>
        While local government units (LGUs) may own the fundamental ICT infrastructure, upgrading it requires a significant budget, which most LGUs can't afford in a short time. Consequently, they face difficulties in financing and implementing the necessary information and communication technology infrastructure, which impacts their ability to accurately gather data, keep up with technological advancements, ensure cybersecurity, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving forward amidst challenges is never easy, and it's even harder to establish policies that ensure accessibility and trustworthiness for all. This task is not solely the responsibility of LGUs. It requires the support and assistance of the national government as well.

  <div class="challenge-establish">
    <h2>Challenges in Establishing Smart Cities in the Philippines</h2>
    <div class="box-container">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Transparency & Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          A pivotal challenge that surfaces in the intricate landscape of implementing smart cities in the Philippines revolves around the imperative need for transparency and the safeguarding of data privacy (Angelidou, 2014).
          The expansive utilization of technology and the inherent data collection processes necessitate the establishment of robust policies and comprehensive frameworks to ensure the secure handling of citizens' information, 
          thereby fostering and maintaining a high level of public trust.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Lack of Capacity to Implement Smart City Initiatives</h3>
        <p>
          A formidable impediment confronting the Philippine smart city endeavors lies in the financial constraints faced by many local government units (LGUs), impeding their capacity to upgrade critical ICT infrastructure (Author, Year). 
          The scarcity of financial resources not only impedes the realization of smart city initiatives but also compromises the ability to acquire accurate data, keep abreast of rapid technological advancements, and fortify cybersecurity measures, thus posing a multifaceted challenge to the holistic success of these initiatives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Social Inclusivity</h3>
        <p>
          Delving deeper into the complex tapestry of challenges, the pursuit of social inclusivity within the ambit of smart city initiatives emerges as a multifaceted conundrum (Author, Year). Achieving this inclusivity entails ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements reach all echelons of society, including marginalized communities. 
          Addressing the digital divide and ensuring universal accessibility stand as pivotal imperatives, underscoring the paramount importance of inclusivity in the overarching success of smart city programs.
